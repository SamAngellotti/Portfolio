        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a second year software engineering student at Western University and I am very interested in attend the IVEY business school. I enjoy to play golf, watersports and snow ski. In my spare time I like to see my friends, watch Suits and Star Wars. Last year I spent my summer working at Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) on the financial planning and ananlysis team (FP&A). I hope to work in a business sector that is similar to work I did at Brookfield</p>
